# Additional options (with defaults)

detectDates: true
camelCase: true
addHypermedia: true

- camelCase: true (also detects Date objects and "GH Objects" like Repo, User, Issue, Pull Request, Gist)
- addHypermedia: true


When both are off, the response should just be the JSON (except paged results. those get a wrapper)

# Paged results

should return {} instead of [] with `items: []` and nextPage, prevPage, etc


# Notes:

- milestone due_on should convert to Date()
- rateLimit reset should convert to Date()
