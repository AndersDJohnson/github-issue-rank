# Redirect

A `Redirect` sets up a redirect to another route in your application to
maintain old URLs.

### Props

#### `from`

The path you want to redirect from, including dynamic segments.

#### `to`

The path you want to redirect to.

#### `query`

By default, the query parameters will just pass through but you can
specify them if you need to.

### Example

```js
// lets say we want to change from `/profile/123` to `/about/123`
// and redirect `/get-in-touch` to `/contact`
<Route component={App}>
  <Route path="about/:userId" component={UserProfile}/>

  {/* `/profile/123` -> `/about/123` */}
  <Redirect from="/profile/:userId" to="/about/:userId" />
</Route>
```

Note that the `<Redirect/>` can be placed anywhere in the route
hierarchy, if you'd prefer the redirects to be next to their respective
routes, the `from` path will match the same as a regular route `path`.
Currently, the `to` property of `<Redirect/>` needs to be an absolute
path. Pull requests welcome to make them handle relative paths too!

```js
<Route path="course/:courseId">
  <Route path="dashboard"/>
  {/* /course/123/home -> /course/123/dashboard */}
  <Redirect from="home" to="/course/:courseId/dashboard" />
</Route>
```
